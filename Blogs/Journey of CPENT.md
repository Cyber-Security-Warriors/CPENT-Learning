## Journey of CPENTÂ Exam by Rakesh Elamaran
Hello Infosec Fam,
I am happy to share that I have achieved my first professional security certificationâ€Š-â€ŠLPT Master and CPENT. 
I will share my exam experience, preparation tips, and course modules. I hope it will help someone who is going to appear for the exam.

## About the Exam
CPENT is a 24Hour Examination, the next level after CEH, to prepare you to become a real-world Pentester. There are so many concepts and technologies that you will learn about in this course.
One Exam, Two Certificates?
Yes, you heard it right!
You have the potential to earn two certifications with one exam. If you score above a 90% on the CPENT live range exam, not only will you earn the CPENT certification, 
but you will also earn the Licensed Penetration Tester (LPT) Master Credential!

## Preparation Tips
I began preparing by watching all the videos and then moving to the course materials. Solve the lab exercises. 
Don't Skip any. One of the best things about CPENT is that you learn to do the same thing multiple ways, so you will have a backup plan.
âž¼Make detailed notes of whatever you are learning and practising this will be a lifesaver during the exam.
âž¼Find relevant rooms in tryhackme, hackthebox and solve as much as you could to gain practical experience.
âž¼Solve vulnhubâ€Š-â€Škioptrix and Rop Primer challenges as well.
âž¼Give importance to new concepts that you are not aware of.
âž¼Follow the methodology, keep your exploits and tools ready.
âž¼Use Practice range effectivelyâ€Š-â€ŠIt will be expired after 30 days once you started.

## Topics in Exam
This is what each section looks like in the exam. You will have 5/6 Sections.
âž¼Capture The Flag Range
âž¼Internet Of things Range
âž¼Binary Range
âž¼Active Directory Range
âž¼Operational Technology Range
âž¼Pivoting and double pivoting
The total Marks would be 3000. The maximum Mark for a question is 125 and the Minimum is 15.

##OSCP and CPENT?
We all know Offensive Security's OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) is the King of all Penetration Testing Certifications. Though OSCP Examination is the tough one so far, CPENT now steals its spot with even tougher Challenges in it.
CPENT Includes Pivoting and Double Pivoting, Weaponization, and Binary exploitations are to be noted. we have to appreciate OSCP for enhancing students' skills in Exploit Development Capabilities on their own where CPENT lacks in that part.
## Exam Experience
I love learning new things, and CPENT was the best course for learning new concepts. It is close to real-life scenarios and helps you understand how real-world penetration tests should be conducted.I Was in Comfort Zone by Procrastinating the exam for more than a year and Finally took my exam in Nov'22. Never ever procrastinate to take the exam. The maximum time you can take for preparation and clearing the exam is 6â€“9 Months. Time will fly by, as there is a hell lot to learn and practice.
I took a 2*12 Hours Exam for my convenience and drained out the last 2â€“3 hours it's been a veryyy longgg time taking exams like this. You got it?
Document Everything you do and take screenshots of flags and the answers you mark for preparing the report. I submitted the report after three days and I got the result in the next two days.
In Short, worth putting in all your efforts, day and night to take this 24 Hours examination and you will get the heavily packed cool physical certificate after 3â€“4 weeks.

Proud to be part of the elite global group of ethical hackers who have cleared Licensed Penetration Tester (LPT Master) and Certified Penetration testing Professional (CPENT).
